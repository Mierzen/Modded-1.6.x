### Goals
* Relaxed, fun, community learning and texturing environment

* Support for [requested mods](http://soartex.net/community/threads/mod-requests.859/)
_We welcome support for any mod!_

### Guidelines
* Be careful to style your work to match the graphics in Soartex. We are happy to help newcomers!
* Feel free to use any texture in the repository or vanilla Soartex, but do not claim them as your own
* Mod names should be capitalized, separated by underscores and should not be abbreviated
* If a mod makes format changes that deprecates textures but does not break support, leave the old files for a few months
* A number of [texture templates, psd and xcf files, scripts and guides](https://github.com/Soartex-Modded/Templates) are available
